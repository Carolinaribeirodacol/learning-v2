                Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function. The JSX code:

                Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.

            <p>
                Use the Production Build
                If you’re benchmarking or experiencing performance problems in your React apps, make sure you’re testing with the minified production build.
                By default, React includes many helpful warnings. These warnings are very useful in development. However, they make React larger and slower so you should make sure to use the production version when you deploy the app.
                If you aren’t sure whether your build process is set up correctly, you can check it by installing React Developer Tools for Chrome. If you visit a site with React in production mode, the icon will have a dark background:
            </p>
            <p>
                Create React App
                If your project is built with Create React App, run:
            </p>
            <section id="code" class="main-section">
                <MyButton color="blue" shadowSize={2}>
                    npm run build
                </MyButton>
            </section>
            <p>
                This will create a production build of your app in the build/ folder of your project.
                Remember that this is only necessary before deploying to production. For normal development, use npm start.
                Single-File Builds
                We offer production-ready versions of React and React DOM as single files:
